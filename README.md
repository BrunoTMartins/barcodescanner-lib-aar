### Current version is: 
https://github.com/zxing/zxing/releases/tag/BS-4.7.6

### This library allows the use of the following extra intents:
- "width" & "height" to draw a viewfinder with custom dimensions;
- "showEnableScanButton" to show a button that enables/disables the scanning process;

### Note:
- In version "ZXing4.7.8" Auto focus is not working correctly with Samsung Galaxy A8, in that case this version is recomended.
